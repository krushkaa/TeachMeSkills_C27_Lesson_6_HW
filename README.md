***Homework for the seventh lesson***

**task1** we created a class "CreditCard" with the fields "Account number" and "Current amount in the account".
Created one constructor with two parameters. Created methods for increasing and decreasing the amount,
outputting information to the console in the new "Account" class and performed operations with them in the "Runner" class.

**task2** we created a class "Student" to describe the students of our group.
Class fields: first name, last name, passport number, group name.
We created objects of this class in the new Program class for each of the students in our group.
We placed all these objects in an array.
We went through the array with a for-each loop and output the information to the console.
